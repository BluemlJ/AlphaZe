        Constructor of the MCTSAgent.
        The MCTSAgent runs playouts/simulations in the search tree and updates the node statistics.
        The final move is chosen according to the visit count of each direct child node.
        One playout is defined as expanding one new node in the tree. In the case of chess this means evaluating a new board position.

        If the evaluation for one move takes too long on your hardware you can decrease the value for:
         nb_playouts_empty_pockets and nb_playouts_filled_pockets.

        For more details and the mathematical equations please take a look at src/domain/agent/README.md as well as the
        official DeepMind-papers.

        :param net: NeuralNetAPI handle which is used to communicate with the neural network
        :param threads: Number of threads to evaluate the nodes in parallel
        :param batch_size: Fixed batch_size which is used in the network prediction service.
                           The batch_size coordinates the prediction flow for the network-prediction service.
                           Using a mxnet executor object which uses a fixed batch_size is faster than accepting
                           arbitrary batch_sizes.
        :param playouts_empty_pockets: Number of playouts/simulations which will be done if the Crazyhouse-Pockets of
                                        both players are empty.
        :param playouts_filled_pockets: Number of playouts/simulations which will be done if at least one player has a
                                        piece in their pocket. The number of legal-moves is higher when drop
                                        moves are available.
        :param cpuct: CPUCT-value which weights the balance between the policy/action and value term.
                     The playstyle depends strongly on this value.
        :param dirichlet_epsilon: Weigh value for the dirichlet noise. If 0. -> no noise. If 1. -> complete noise.
                                The dirichlet noise ensures that unlikely nodes can be explored
        :param dirichlet_alpha: Alpha parameter of the dirichlet noise which is applied to the prior policy for the
                                current root node: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_process
        :param max_search_depth: Maximum search depth to reach in the current search tree. If the depth has been reached
                                the evaluation stops.
        :param temperature: The temperature parameters is an exponential scaling factor which is applied to the
                            posterior policy. Afterwards the chosen move to play is sampled from this policy.
                            Range: [0.,1.]:
                            If 0. -> Deterministic policy. The move is chosen with the highest probability
                            If 1. -> Pure random sampling policy. The move is sampled from the posterior without any
                                    scaling being applied.
        :param clip_quantil: A quantil clipping parameter with range [0., 1.]. All cummulated low percentages for moves
                            are set to 0. This makes sure that very unlikely moves (blunders) are clipped after
                            the exponential scaling.
        :param: q_value_weight: Float indicating how the number of visits and the q-values should be mixed.
                                Expected to be in range [0.,1.]
        :param virtual_loss: An artificial loss term which is applied to each node which is currently being visited.
                             This term make it look like that the current visit of this node led to +X losses where X
                             is the virtual loss. This prevents that every thread will evaluate the same node.
        :param verbose: Defines weather to print out info messages for the current calculated line
        :param min_movetime: Minimum time in milliseconds to search for the best move
